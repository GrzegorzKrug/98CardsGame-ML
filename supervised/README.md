# My Notes

This is Supervised approach.
Currently model is ovetrained, and repeat moves. will fix this.


# I do know how to beat this game
in result neural network will also not beat it.

I am learning machine to play this game my way.

This method was not meant to succed. I was just curious if machine can figure out some better moves to get higher score.
